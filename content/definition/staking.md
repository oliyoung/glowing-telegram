Staking is the process of holding and locking up a certain amount of cryptocurrency or tokens in a specific wallet or platform, in order to support the operation and maintenance of a blockchain network. By participating in staking, individuals can earn rewards in the form of additional cryptocurrency or tokens for [helping to secure the network.]({{< ref "concepts/staking-security" >}})

The mechanism behind staking is different depending on the blockchain protocol that is being used. Some blockchain protocols use a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which allows users to validate transactions and create new blocks by holding and staking their tokens. In these cases, the more tokens a user stakes, the higher their chances of being chosen to validate a transaction and earn a reward.

Other blockchain protocols use a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) mechanism where token holders can vote for a set of delegates who will validate transactions on their behalf. In this case, the delegates are rewarded for their work and the token holders are rewarded for staking their tokens and voting for a delegate.

It is important to note that staking also has a risk, in case of a hack or any other security problem of the platform, stakers may lose the tokens that they have staked.
