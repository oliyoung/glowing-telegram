Yield farmers are individuals or entities that use their cryptocurrency holdings to earn a return on their investment through a process called _"yield farming"_.

This typically involves lending or [staking]({{< ref "staking" >}}) their assets to a [decentralized finance (DeFi)]({{< ref "defi" >}} ) protocol, which then uses those assets to provide liquidity to the platform and generate returns for the lender. Yield farming can also involve participating in liquidity pools, providing collateral for loans, or participating in other types of DeFi activities.

The term yield farming is often used to refer to the practice of earning interest on one's crypto assets, or the use of liquidity provision strategies in decentralized finance protocols to generate returns.
