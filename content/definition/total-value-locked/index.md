Total Value Locked (TVL) is a metric used in the [decentralized finance (DeFi)]({{< ref "defi" >}}) space to measure the total value of [assets locked]({{< ref "../staking" >}}) into various DeFi protocols.

This can include assets such as cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and stablecoins, as well as other digital assets like non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

TVL is often used as a measure of the overall size and health of the DeFi ecosystem, as well as to track the growth of individual protocols within it.
