A liquidity pool is a collection of assets, such as cash or other securities, that can be used to meet the financial obligations of an institution or market.

In the context of cryptocurrency, a liquidity pool refers to a pool of funds that is used to provide liquidity to a trading pair on a [decentralized exchange (DEX)]. This allows traders to buy and sell assets without the need for an intermediary and helps to ensure that there is always a buyer or seller for any given asset.
