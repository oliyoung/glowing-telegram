Decentralized finance (DeFi) refers to the use of blockchain technology and smart contracts to create decentralized financial systems and applications that operate independently of traditional financial intermediaries such as banks and governments. These systems can include [lending] and borrowing platforms, [insurance]({{< ref "outcomes/insurance" >}}) protocols, [prediction] markets, and other financial services that run on blockchain networks like [Ethereum].

One of the key features of DeFi is the use of [smart contracts], which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. This allows DeFi applications to operate in a transparent and [trustless] manner, with no need for a central authority to oversee or mediate the transactions. This also allows for the creation of more [open and inclusive financial systems]({{< ref "concepts/defi-accessible" >}}), as DeFi can provide access to financial services to individuals and businesses that may not have had access to them before.

Overall, DeFi aims to create a more open and accessible financial system, where individuals and organizations have greater control over their assets and financial transactions and can access a wider range of financial services.
