A derivative is a financial contract that derives its value from an underlying asset. These underlying assets can be stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates, or market indexes. Derivatives are often used to manage risk or for speculative purposes.

There are several types of derivatives, including:

* Futures: a contract to buy or sell an underlying asset at a fixed price and date in the future
* Options: a contract that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a fixed price and date in the future
* Swaps: a contract in which two parties agree to exchange cash flows in the future based on a set of predetermined conditions
* Perpetual contracts: a type of derivative contract that closely track the price of an underlying asset, but do not have a fixed expiration date.

Derivatives can be traded on regulated exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC) markets, and they can be used for a variety of purposes, such as hedging against price fluctuations, generating income, or making speculative investments.
