Decentralized finance (DeFi) is more accessible because it is built on blockchain technology, which allows for a decentralized and open financial system that is **accessible to anyone with an internet connection**.

This **eliminates the need for intermediaries** such as banks and traditional financial institutions, making it possible for individuals to access financial services directly.

Additionally, DeFi **allows for greater accessibility to financial services in underbanked or unbanked areas**, and can provide greater transparency and security.
