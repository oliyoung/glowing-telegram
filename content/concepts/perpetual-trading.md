Perpetuals trading refers to the buying and selling of [perpetual contracts], which are a type of [derivative product] that closely track the price of an underlying asset, such as a cryptocurrency or commodity, but do not have a fixed expiration date.

Unlike traditional futures contracts, which have a specific expiration date and settle at the price of the underlying asset on that date, perpetual contracts allow traders to hold their position indefinitely, as long as they maintain sufficient margin to cover any potential losses.

Perpetuals trading is typically conducted on [decentralized exchanges (DEX)] and centralized exchanges (CEX) and it is popular on crypto markets.
